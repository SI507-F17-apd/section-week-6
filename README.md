# Debug this code

There are 4 bugs related:
1. syntax / definition
1. caching
1. repeated content
1. undesired content like 'section X - page Y'

As you read the code and try to find bugs, add new comments based on what you understand. Ask questions to yourself when you don't:
1. Look at the constants. What do you understand from them?
1. What is each block of code doing?
1. Write missing DocStrings in the 2nd half of the code like those written in caching functions
1. How is the code organized? Look at how arguments are passed to different functions.
1. Try to understand how it all comes together at the end.
1. As you notice something different from how you usually write code, think about how would you have written it. (The next project is about collaboration and you will need to read, understand and adapt to each others' style of writing code.)

# Extend this code

- Make it an interactive experience
- Ask which section does the user want to read
- Then only show that section's articles
    - For each story, show related articles
